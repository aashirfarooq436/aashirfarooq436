# Hi there, I'm Aashir Farooq! 👋
I'm a Computer Engineer with a passion for **Full Stack Software Development** and **Cloud Computing**. After diving into data science, I've shifted my focus to building scalable and high-performance web applications. I'm excited to showcase my journey through this repository.

## 👨‍💻 Here's what you'll find in this repo:
- 💻 **Full Stack Applications**:  
  Web applications built with modern technologies like React, Node.js, Django, and integrated with cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. These projects demonstrate my expertise in both front-end and back-end development, delivering responsive and functional user experiences.
- 🌐 **Backend Development**:  
  RESTful APIs, database design, and server-side programming with frameworks like Express and Django. My projects highlight best practices for performance, security, and scalability.
- ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps**:  
  Cloud-based solutions, serverless architecture, and deployment pipelines. You'll find projects utilizing cloud services for scalability, automation, and high availability, with hands-on experience in CI/CD workflows.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Projects**:  
  While my main focus is now on software development, you can still explore a smaller collection of machine learning models and algorithms, applied to real-world problems.
